# Application Title: RunInfo

## Configuration Settings

_Include any gradle or configuration settings that are required for your libraries or app to work_

## API Key

_Let the course staff know whether or not your app requires an API Key and to whom it was sent
via email_

## Reading the Code: 

_Detail how you would like the person who grades your app's code to do so. This could include 
giving them a UML diagram, or what is the best order to read the application files in_

After running the app, the app will open up its first screen - the home screen, where the 
current acceleration is shown. You can navigate to the 2nd screen - the timer screen where you
can start a timer to mark the start of your run. While the timer is running, you may walk or run
or gently shake the phone/emulator to simulate a running motion.
Once done, stop the timer and you can see information about the run.
Repeat this a few more times, then you may go to the 3rd screen - history page where you can see
blocks of data about past runs with timestamps.
You can use the delete button to delete all the history blocks.
