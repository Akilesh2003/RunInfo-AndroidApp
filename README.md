# RunInfo

## Reading the Code: 

After running the app, the app will open up its first screen - the home screen, where the 
current acceleration is shown. 

You can navigate to the 2nd screen - the timer screen where you
can start a timer to mark the start of your run. 

While the timer is running, you may walk or run
or gently shake the phone/emulator to simulate a running motion.
Once done, stop the timer and you can see information about the run.

Repeat this a few more times, then you may go to the 3rd screen - history page where you can see
blocks of data about past runs with timestamps.

You can use the delete button to delete all the history blocks.
